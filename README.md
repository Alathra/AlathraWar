### Dependencies: Vault, Towny, SiegeWar, TAB

### Commands
+ /war - war commands
+ /siege - siege commands

## Siege Point system
+1 point for every second the homeblock is controlled. Defenders retain control if no one is occupying the homeblock. A contested homeblock yeilds no points. The timer fires every 10 seconds so it's really +10 points every 10 seconds. Kills are worth 20 points each.

## Siege Time Limit
Sieges last 90 minutes. After this time is up the side with the most points wins. A tie goes to the defenders.

## Siege Cost
The attackers must put down $20,000 to start a siege. If they win they get this $20,000 back as well as 1/4th the bank of the town OR $20,000, whichever is higher. If the defenders win they sieze the $20,000 initially put down on the siege by the attackers
